Got questions? We've got answers. 

## 1. WHAT IS THE ROPER LAB FOR DATA IN COMMUNITY NEWS?

We've just launched, so some of it is still being worked out. But at it's heart, the Roper Lab is a place for students to get experience working on real world data journalism stories while helping Nebraska's local media get access to the tools and possibilities of data journalism for their publications. We believe fiercely that the tools that journalists in New York and Washington DC work just as well in Ainsworth and Osceola. 

## 2. WHAT ISN'T THE ROPER LAB?

We're not a web development shop. We're not going to fix your website. We can't build you a better publication engine. We're also not a short-order graphics desk. We can show you some tools for all of those things, but they're not our mission. Our mission is to create local stories of statewide scope -- things that affect all Nebraskan's, but through the lens of each local outlet. 

## 3. WHO IS THE ROPER LAB?

The faculty leading the Roper Lab have more than two decades of professional data journalism experience. [Olga Pierce](https://journalism.unl.edu/olga-pierce) spent more than a decade at ProPublica in New York, working on complex, data-heavy investigations into health care and other topics. [Matt Waite](https://journalism.unl.edu/matt-waite-1) worked in newspapers in Arkansas and Florida for a dozen years, winning awards for investigative journalism in the environment, education and law enforcement. He also built PolitiFact.com, the first website to win a Pulitzer Prize in 2009. 

## 4. WE HAVE AN IDEA. HOW DO WE GET HELP?

Easy. Email [Olga](mailto:opierce2@unl.edu) or [Matt](mailto:matt.waite@unl.edu). 

## 5. HOW DO WE GET YOUR STORIES?

We publish all of our stories, for free, through the Nebraska News Service. Already a member? You don't need to do anything. Not a member but interested? Email [Jill Martin](mailto:jmartin42@unl.edu) and she'll add you to the distribution list.

## 6. WHAT CAN WE EXPECT WITH STORIES? 

It'll depend on the story. Some will be a main story written by us, with local information broken down for individual counties or cities. In some cases, we'll create stories for each county individually, either manually or using code to write the localized paragraphs. Sometimes we'll provide the data and a reporting receipe to help you report your local situation. We're open to ideas.
